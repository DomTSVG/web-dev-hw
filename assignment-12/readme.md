1. The fake company that I used was the company I am using in the development of my mod for Stardew Valley called Plentiful Harvest. This company is a company that sends out a subscription magazine containing seeds for different seasons and allows me to implement them without the need for extra shops or mods. The description would have been; "We need a site that gives the farm aesthetic and uses browns and greens as the primary colors. Our themes are rustic atmousphere and radiance. We offer seeds as a subscription service for gardeners of every season."
2. The difference between displays, like block and inline, comes down to how they are organized on the site. Inline elements ignore margins, padding, and more, and usually ignore width elements. Blocks are used for navigation bars usually, and inline-blocks are a mixture of the two. 
3. The work cycle for this was simple... Right from the beginning I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to create a site based on my own experience, and the mod was perfect for it. I set up the site based on some of my previous work to save time, helping design the nav bar and copyright section at the bottom to make it look professional. I found some text generators and went to work designing the positioning and found placeholder images. All it took then was putting it together and putting the forms up, and we were set.
