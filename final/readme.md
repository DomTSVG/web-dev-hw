1. Of course I did! I now have the tools to create a real website, albeit rudamentary. This is another notch in my belt so I can expand my repitoire. I learned about CSS, which brings me the most development. I can use that in particular in multiple places. Repositories and github are not new to me, but it's always good to refresh.
2. Building on this, I also took my vector class this semester so this and that class really helped me with typography and color. Hopefully I've struck a good ballance over the course of this class.
3. The work cycle for this assignment really started back when class started. I had ideas that formulated about showcasing my work, and thus I would bring it to fruition. I started fresh, from scratch, set up and did what I hadn't done before; used comments. Step one was the navbar. I set that up, with the logo, made it sticky... I added all my social media in a dropdown, and then went on to designing the other pages. All details aside, I wanted to make sure the archives had a good format to them. Lastly, I added the comment section. Honestly, I put the most work into this site, and I couldn't be happier with the result.
