1. When looking at everything for this assignment, I chose fonts and colors that mimiced both the original review page and the game's logo. I chose my favorite font as well, Ranchers. After it being my own work, how could I not?
2. System fonts are fonts that are on the local system, and used by it. Web fonts are custom fonts held on a server and require certain things to appear properly, since they don't have to be on a user's system. Web safe fonts are widely used fonts that are good to use as fallbacks or general use for web development so fonts appear on all devices and browsers.
3. I picked my writing, of course it would be my own, considering last year I had taken a leap in my own writing career. I then picked all my fonts and my colors based on that. I then took everything and set it up, CSS included, and tweaked everything before writing this readme. Bang, zing, pow.
