1. Divs are the dividors between nections of the body of a page. The classes given determine what those divs are labeled as, like an ID, but multiple classes can be used on an element. Only one ID can be on a particular element. Spans are like Divs, but are inline instead of block.
2. Alt text is text that is displayed when an image, video, or other element can't be displayed. We use it to convey error messages and metadata too, letting viewers know if the site is not loading something properly, or simply to provide more info.
3. My work cycle for this assignment was plain and simple, save for the audio and video tags. I had multiple issues that I had to solve for both, but it amounted to drawing from the website for tags and proper formatting. The workflow went as such;

 Setup directoty > choose song > found lyrics > found album art > found souncloud > found video > build documents > embed media > test > solve errors > commit.

 I don't have anything else to ask about or want to learn more about this time. What's done is done.
