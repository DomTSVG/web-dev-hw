1. The differences between universal, element, class, and ID selectors is based on their scope. The lower you go in scope, the fewer things the CSS style affects. You would choose universal to affect the whole site, and general text spanning it, whereas you would use the incremental styles, like class, element, and ID, to stylize specific portions based on their classifications and the placement.
2. The best way to descibe the color pallate I chose is neon/vaporwave. Navy blue with bright white, pink, and other colors. I used the pink, blue, and white, as they were pleasing to the eye.
3. The work cycle for this assignment took me from selecting my style, which I actually chose by first researching when the 8 bit style came to be. I then chose from the time period to determine the colors... And then I worked on the html, built the structure, the css, and the tying of everything together.
