    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h5><cite>For pastry crust:</cite></h5>
    <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons sugar </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons ice-cold milk (or water)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><cite>For berry filling:</cite></h5>
    <ul>
    <li>2 cups fresh blueberries (about 1 pint) </li>
    <li>1 cup fresh raspberries (about 1/2 pint) </li>
    <li>1/3 cup sugar, plus more for sprinkling on top (about 1 to 2 tablespoons) </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter, cut into 8 pieces</li>
    <li>1 large egg </li>
    <li>1 to 2 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine first 3 ingredients in a large bowl. Mix in 1 cup cold butter with a pastry blender or two forks until mixture resembles coarse meal. Whisk together egg yolk and 3 tablespoons milk; pour into flour mixture, stirring just until dough starts to form a ball. Press together with lightly floured hands, and form into a flat round. Cover with plastic wrap; place in refrigerator at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
      <li>Combine blueberries, raspberries, 1/3 cup sugar, and next 4 ingredients in a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Remove dough from refrigerator; divide evenly into 8 pieces. Roll each piece on a lightly floured surface into about 6-inch rounds; place on 2 lightly greased large baking sheets. Scoop 1/4 cup berry mixture into center of each round; top each with butter. Fold about 1 inch of dough over fruit all the way around to form a rim.</li>
      <li>Combine egg and milk; brush outside of each tart with the egg wash. Sprinkle tarts with about 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar. Bake at 375° for 40 to 45 minutes or until golden brown, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Let cool on pan 5 minutes. Remove to a wire rack; let cool. Serve with lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.</li>
