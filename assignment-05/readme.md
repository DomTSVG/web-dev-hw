1. There may be only one head portion and one body portion in an HTML document, otherwise the page doesn't function. These elements are vastly different. While the header contains metadata for the site, while the body is actually visible on the page, the body.
2. Structural and semantic markup differ in what they do to a particular portion of the page. Structural markup determines things like headers and lists, while semantic markup simply modifies text on a page into bolds, italics, and other things.
3. The work cycle for this project was simple. Take my favorite crostata recipe and follow the directions. However, my interest rose as I worked, so it was more of a cycle of "do assignment, find interest, work." Honestly not sure what else I'm supposed to be writing about.
