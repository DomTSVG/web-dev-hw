How is the web different from the internet?
-------------------------------------------
Well, plainly put, it refers to the way the two are built. 
The internet is a connection of networks over which computers and other devices can communicate.
The world wide web is an idea that information on those networks can be connected through hyperlinks rather than branches.
In this sense, the web is referring to the collection of information on the internet, and how it is connected together.

-------------------------------------------
How does the internet actually work?
-------------------------------------------
The internet works as a "wire" of sorts that many servers with different IP addresses connect to.
Web pages on the internet are actually stored on those servers' hard drives.
We find these pages by locating and connecting our computer to these IP addresses, usually represented by web URLs.
Your computer is a client connected to the internet via an ISP.
The information your computer sends to connect goes through the ISP and to the website server.
Further on, the website's server can send information to another client. 
Website clients can also connect to eachother through the internet.

-------------------------------------------
What is a directory in relation to files?
-------------------------------------------
A directory is a branch of file folders in a sense, used to organize files into a heirarchy.
In this sense, it's like a group of folders you'd create on your computer for photos and whatnot.
On the web, these directories work like a path to find pages, images, and more... Files!
How these folders are grouped determines how the service works, and how we find different files within.

------------------------------------------
Why use a VCS?
------------------------------------------
Using a version control system or "VCS" allows you to view the changes made to files in a repository.
Why this is helpful draws back to the root of the creation of files and code.
When you make changes, those changes need to be heavily documented, and a VCS makes sure that it is.
You can usually view all of your changes made through a VCS so that you can undo or return to a previous version.
A VCS can also serve as an organizational tool for the files and repositories.

------------------------------------------
What's something that I didn't know before?
------------------------------------------
I didn't know that the very first bit of information sent over the internet was not only a failure, but two letters, "L" and "O".
The development of the internet is a fascinating process that isn't known by many, apparently.
While we group together the internet and the web, most people don't know the difference.
Learning that difference was helpful and interesting.
